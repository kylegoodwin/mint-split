## Work in progress
Building a chrome extension to automate the manual labor I have been doing to split expenses with my partner. Requires you to log in to Mint.com and have it tracking your various accounts. The goal is to have a table where you can just select the transactions you would like to split with a checkbox, and have this extension output a split total with a breakdown as a table.

TODO:
- [x] Pull data from mint.com
- [x] Display all transactions on a table
- [x] Allow transactions to be selected
- [ ] Do math to split the tab
- [x] Exportable receipt of split transactions
- [ ] Keep track of last transaction so you know where to start for the next tab

Future Ideas:
- [ ] Paste output straight into google doc using Google Drive API
